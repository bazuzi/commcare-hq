## Analytics
We use multiple Analytics platforms. Google Analytics and Kissmetrics calls are done mainly using respective Javascript APIs. We track few aggregated user properties on [Kissmetrics from server side](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/analytics/tasks.py#L210). For Hubspot we use their REST API from server side as well.

[Directory of events and properties we track in these platforms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1frMdFeznNcMAIyMW3pG3zes6mmY03UG67HyMUHXlb-s/edit#gid=1804103672)

### Google Analytics and Kissmetrics
See [analytics_all.html](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/blob/master/corehq/apps/style/templates/style/includes/analytics_all.html) and see example usages

### Hubspot

#### Adding/Removing Hubspot properties

We track various user properties as [Hubspot Contact Properties](http://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts-user-guide-v2/how-to-use-contact-and-company-properties). We have bunch of celery tasks and function that update these contact properties via [Hubspot REST API](http://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/contacts/create_or_update). We can update only those properties that are available on Hubspot portal. When we mention new Hubspot properties in HQ-Hubspot API calls, make sure that these properties are available in Hubspot portal. If they are not available, [create](http://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-contact-and-company-properties) them or ping marketing team to have them created on Hubspot portal first.

#### Testing

To start testing, run Celery and update `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` and `HUBSPOT_ID` in `settings.ANALYTICS_IDS`. Hubspot provides a public demo portal with API access for testing. The credentials for this are available on their [API overview page](http://developers.hubspot.com/docs/overview). If you need to test using our production portal the credentials can be found in dimagi_shared keepass. Let marketing know before testing on production portal and clean-up after the testing is finished
